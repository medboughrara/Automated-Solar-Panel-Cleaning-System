# Automated Solar Panel Cleaning System

## Project Overview

This project provides an automated solution for cleaning solar panels, designed to function without human intervention. By keeping panels free from dust and debris, the system helps maintain optimal energy output and reduces the need for manual maintenance.

## Features

- Fully automated cleaning cycles
- Adaptable to various solar panel setups
- Increases panel efficiency by preventing dust accumulation
- Reduces operational costs and maintenance labor

## Scientific Impact

Dirty solar panels can lose up to 30% of their energy yield due to dust, sand, and environmental pollution. Frequent manual cleaning is costly, labor-intensive, and not always feasible, especially for large-scale solar farms or installations in remote areas.

### Contribution to Renewable Energy

This project addresses one of the critical challenges in solar energy production: maintaining high panel efficiency. By automating the cleaning process, the system:

- **Maximizes Energy Harvest**: Keeps panels operating at or near peak efficiency, improving the overall output of solar installations.
- **Supports Sustainable Development**: Reduces water and chemical usage compared to traditional cleaning methods, supporting eco-friendly energy generation.
- **Enables Deployment in Harsh Environments**: Makes solar power more viable in regions with high dust, sand, or pollution, broadening the applicability of renewable energy.
- **Reduces Maintenance Footprint**: Lowers the need for human labor and exposure to hazardous conditions, making large-scale solar farms safer and more cost-effective.

## Getting Started

1. Upload the `.ino` code to your Arduino or compatible microcontroller.
2. Assemble the cleaning mechanism as described in the documentation.
3. Connect the system to your solar panels and supply power.
4. The system will automatically begin monitoring and cleaning as needed.
